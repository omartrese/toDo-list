# TODO LIST

This is my last project to finish with the frontend development for now

this is a so basic todo list that saves tasks in memory in the browser with the ***localStorage*** API that comes with the browsers and javascript

here the command you need to run to have this project if you want to modify or see it (obviusly having installed GIT):

```
git clone https://github.com/omartrese/toDo-list.git
```
